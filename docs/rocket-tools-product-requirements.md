**Use Case Summary:**
In this use case, the Rocket Tools website allows users to explore and run AI-powered tools directly within a static Hugo-generated interface. The user begins by selecting a **tool group** from the left sidebar, which expands to reveal its tools. Upon choosing a specific tool, the **main content area** dynamically updates to display educational materials, metadata, and input instructions—content generated by a backend AI agent and embedded as front matter in the Hugo page. The user then enters their input and clicks **“Run Tool”**, triggering an **HTMX** request to a **Netlify serverless function**, where lightweight backend logic processes the request and communicates with an **LLM** to generate a response. The result is streamed back and displayed instantly on the same page, while **Alpine.js** manages visual feedback, loading states, and error handling to ensure continuous interactivity. This creates a seamless, educational, and fully reactive user experience—blending static site performance with dynamic, AI-driven functionality.

## USE CASE WITH IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Developer Instructions:**
This YAML serves as the **functional and technical blueprint** for building the Rocket Tools website. It outlines the full system architecture, defining how each technology—Hugo, Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI, HTMX, Alpine.js, and Netlify Functions—interacts across the frontend and backend. The developer should use this YAML as a **reference document** to guide implementation structure, ensuring each component (sidebar navigation, tool rendering, input handling, and serverless execution) aligns with the described flow. The YAML provides a **big-picture roadmap**, not code-level instructions, so developers are free to determine implementation details (file structure, variable naming, etc.) while maintaining the workflow, data relationships, and interactivity model specified here. Treat each major section—architecture, structure, runtime flow, and deployment—as a modular development phase to ensure consistent integration across the static Hugo build and dynamic HTMX/Alpine.js interactions.

      Rocket Tools uses a custom taxonomy model designed specifically for
      tool organization and discovery. Instead of Hugo’s built-in
      "categories" and "tags", we define "tool_groups" and "tool_tags"
      manually through data files and front matter. Each tool page is a
      self-contained Hugo content entry with AI-generated front matter
      metadata.
