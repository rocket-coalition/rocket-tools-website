  # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Technique Name
  technique: "Task-to-Goal Reframing"
  # ‚Üí The core conceptual method this tool demonstrates.
  # Example: ‚ÄúGoal-Oriented Prompting‚Äù, ‚ÄúPsychological Persona Design‚Äù, ‚ÄúEmergent Logic Chain‚Äù

  # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pattern / Mental Model
  pattern: "Stop Micromanaging the AI"
  # ‚Üí The ‚Äúbig idea‚Äù family this tool belongs to.
  # This connects to your category (so users can navigate conceptually).

  # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Principle
  principle: "Give the AI a goal, not a list of steps."
  # ‚Üí The distilled one-sentence *law* this tool is teaching.

  # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement
  problem_it_solves: >
    Many users over-script their AI by giving 10+ specific steps.
    This causes brittleness and breaks when language or context changes.

  # 5Ô∏è‚É£ Why It Matters
  importance: >
    The tool teaches users how to stop ‚Äúmicromanaging‚Äù and start ‚Äúdelegating goals.‚Äù
    This is foundational to designing scalable, motive-driven AI systems.

  # 6Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Shift
  mindset_shift: >
    From ‚ÄúI tell the AI *how* to do it‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúI tell the AI *what outcome I want*.‚Äù

  # 7Ô∏è‚É£ How to Use It
  usage_guidelines:
    - "Paste an over-engineered prompt."
    - "Click 'Run Tool'."
    - "Study the output YAML for patterns of brittleness."
    - "Rewrite your prompt as a high-level goal statement."

  # 8Ô∏è‚É£ Example in Action
  teaching_example: |
    Old prompt: "1. Ask the user‚Äôs name. 2. Ask for their problem. 3. Say thank you."
    New goal: "Politely capture the user‚Äôs problem and contact info."

  # 9Ô∏è‚É£ Common Mistakes
  pitfalls:
    - "Giving exact steps instead of goals."
    - "Leaving out context (‚Äòwho‚Äô, ‚Äòwhy‚Äôname)."
    - "Focusing on word count instead of usefulness."

  # üîü Key Takeaways
  takeaways:
    - "Goal-oriented prompts are more flexible and robust."
    - "You can teach the AI ‚Äòwhy‚Äô instead of scripting every ‚Äòhow‚Äô."
    - "This method increases creative reasoning and reduces failure rate."

# ===============================================
name: "Brittle Prompt Detector"
category: "Stop Micromanaging the AI"
core-concept: |
  Detects weak or brittle instructions in overly procedural AI prompts.
description: |
  The Brittle Prompt Detector analyzes prompts for signs of fragility‚Äîcommands that
  are too rigid, overly detailed, or context-dependent. It identifies where your
  AI prompt could fail, then explains *why* and suggests how to rewrite it as a
  goal-oriented instruction. This tool teaches developers to design resilient,
  self-adaptive prompts that focus on *outcomes*, not steps.

# ===============================================
# 3. APPLICABILITY & STRATEGY
# ===============================================
primary-use-case: |
  Diagnose and improve prompts that break easily when slightly reworded or used
  in new contexts.
when-to-use: |
  - When your AI stops producing reliable results after minor phrasing changes.
  - When you notice your prompt depends too much on step-by-step scripting.
  - When you want to convert ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù prompts into ‚Äúgoal-based‚Äù ones.
when-not-to-use: |
  - When testing simple, factual, or one-shot questions.
  - When optimizing for speed and token efficiency over interpretability.
strengths: |
  - Identifies failure points before deployment.
  - Encourages more generalizable, motive-driven prompt design.
  - Produces clear YAML diagnostic reports for analysis or tooling.
weaknesses: |
  - Does not automatically fix the prompt ‚Äî it provides analysis only.
  - May over-flag creative prompts as ‚Äúbrittle‚Äù if they use step-like formatting.

# ===============================================
# 4. TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT
# ===============================================
system-prompt: |
  You are the Brittle Prompt Detector.
  Your task is to evaluate prompts for fragility and over-specificity.
  Return your analysis in YAML with:
    - status: "Brittle" or "Resilient"
    - confidence: (0‚Äì100)
    - issues: (list of weak points)
    - suggestion: (rewrite idea)
  Be concise, constructive, and objective.

user-prompt-template: |
  Analyze this prompt for brittleness or fragility:
  {user_input}

# ===============================================
# 5. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (For Developers)
# ===============================================
implementation-notes: |
  - Output Parsing: The YAML response can be parsed into a table or diagnostic view.
  - This pattern works well for prompt QA systems or LLM training validation.
  - The output can also be used as metadata in version-controlled prompt libraries.
model-compatibility: |
  - Works best with GPT-4+, Claude 3+, or any model with strong reasoning capabilities.
  - Smaller or instruction-only models may skip detailed analysis.
dependencies: |
  - None (can run as a standalone text-based diagnostic)
recommended-parameters:
  temperature: 0.2
  max_tokens: 800

# ===============================================
# 6. EVIDENCE & EXAMPLES
# ===============================================
example-input: |
  1. Greet the user.
  2. Ask for their name.
  3. Ask for their email.
  4. Ask for their problem.
  5. Say "thank you."
example-output: |
  analysis:
    status: "Brittle"
    confidence: 88
    issues:
      - "Step 2: 'Ask for name' may fail if user data is already known."
      - "Step 4: Too procedural; lacks a defined end goal."
    suggestion: >
      Rewrite this prompt as a goal: "Politely capture the user's name,
      contact info, and problem description."

# ===============================================
# 7. RELATIONSHIPS & REFERENCES
# ===============================================

  - "Resilience Analyzer" ‚Äî compares two prompts for robustness differences.
  - "Prompt Health Check" ‚Äî tests prompts under multiple phrasings.

# üß© Brittle Prompt Detector

The **Brittle Prompt Detector** helps you find *weak spots* in your AI prompts ‚Äî places where your instructions depend too heavily on specific wording or steps.  
Think of it as a **prompt stress test**: it looks for logic that‚Äôs too rigid or under-contextualized.

### üß† What It Teaches
- How to recognize *brittleness*: prompts that fail when one step changes.
- Why goal-oriented prompts are more reliable and adaptive.
- How to turn step-by-step ‚Äúscripts‚Äù into flexible ‚Äúobjectives‚Äù.

### üß≠ Why Developers Use It
Prompt engineers, AI architects, and technical teams use this tool to build **resilient** systems that perform consistently under varied inputs.  
It‚Äôs perfect for auditing LLM workflows, pipelines, or conversation templates.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Paste your full prompt (even if it‚Äôs ugly).  
2. Run the detector ‚Äî it returns YAML analysis.  
3. Study the issues and rewrite your prompt as a goal statement.  
4. Use the suggestion as a base for the **Task-to-Goal Reframing** pattern.

### üéØ Example
**Input Prompt:**
