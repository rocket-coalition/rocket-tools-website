Here’s a strong **prompt** you can use to generate a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for your AI Tools site — written from the **use case and product design** perspective (not tech specs). This prompt guides the AI to reason like a **product engineer and stakeholder**, understanding user intent, journey, and system purpose at a conceptual level.

---

### 🧠 **Prompt: Product Requirements Document (Use Case–Driven)**

> You are a **product engineer and stakeholder team** tasked with designing a web platform for a set of **AI transformation tools**.
> Your goal is to write a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** that captures the **use cases, purpose, structure, and philosophy** of this system.
> The PRD should **not** focus on technical frameworks or backend systems — instead, it must deeply explore the **user goals, context, motivation, and flow** of interaction with the site.

#### **Context**

The site is a **developer-feeling, tool-based platform** with a **left-hand sidebar menu** listing grouped AI tools. Each category (like “Stop Micromanaging the AI,” “Give the AI a ‘Why’,” or “Build an AI Character Sheet”) contains multiple sub-tools.
When a user clicks a tool name, the **entire right side** of the screen becomes that tool’s workspace.
The aesthetic should feel like a **2000s developer IDE** — clean, functional, icon-assisted, minimal ornamentation.
The purpose is to help users transform how they **think about and design AI systems** — moving from micromanaging “task lists” to building motive-driven, goal-oriented, psychologically rich AIs.

#### **Your Task**

Write a **Product Requirements Document** that captures the *why*, *who*, and *how* of this product through the eyes of:

* The **end user** (AI builders, prompt engineers, innovators)
* The **stakeholder** (organization creating a coherent tool ecosystem)
* The **product engineer** (focusing on flow, usability, and structure)

---

### **The PRD Should Contain These Sections:**

1. **Product Vision**

   * What problem this product solves and what kind of transformation it provides.
   * The conceptual philosophy (from micromanagement → goal-based design).

2. **User Archetypes / Personas**

   * Define 3–5 user types (e.g., “AI Tinkerers,” “Prompt Architects,” “Agency Strategists,” “Corporate Innovators”).
   * Describe their goals, frustrations, and why this platform matters to them.

3. **Core Use Cases**

   * Describe typical user journeys:

     * Discovering and exploring tool categories.
     * Running a tool and interacting with its inputs/outputs.
     * Understanding insights and saving / exporting results.
   * Each use case should feel like a “day in the life” of the user.

4. **Information Architecture**

   * Describe the structural layout of the site.
   * Explain how categories, tools, and tool outputs are organized.
   * Detail the mental model (left = navigation, right = workspace).

5. **Interaction Model**

   * Explain what happens when a user clicks a tool, how the workspace loads, and how the UI responds.
   * Describe how icons, grouping, and hierarchy communicate purpose.
   * Keep focus on *user cognition and clarity* — not animation or style.

6. **Experience Principles**

   * What feelings and cognitive flow should the site enable?
   * Examples: “Fast understanding,” “Exploratory learning,” “Psychological depth, not flashiness.”

7. **Content Strategy**

   * How tool descriptions, examples, and language reinforce learning.
   * How tone stays instructional, direct, and empowering — not marketing-driven.

8. **Success Metrics**

   * Define what “success” means for users and stakeholders (e.g., number of tools used, rate of completion, clarity of insights gained, number of revisits).

9. **Future Opportunities**

   * Suggest possible expansions (like user accounts, saved personas, or “World Bible” builders).
   * Highlight community or collaborative features that align with the philosophy.

### **Instructions for the AI**

* Focus on **conceptual clarity**, **use case flow**, and **user motivation**.
* Avoid front-end technology or implementation details.
* Write in a **professional, narrative tone** suitable for presentation to stakeholders or investors.
* Use Markdown formatting for readability.

Would you like me to **run this prompt now** to generate the full PRD draft for your site?
I can produce it in a structured, narrative format that reads like a real stakeholder document.
